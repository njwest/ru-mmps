# ![rutgers shield](https://github.com/njwest/ru-mmps/blob/master/shieldicon.png) Rutgers 2017 DSW Multimedia Projects (MMPs)

This is the repository for the 2017 Rutgers DSW Multimedia Projects presentation page, containing links to the 15 DSW Class of 2017 multimedia project websites in addition to an embedded Soundcloud playlist of their multimedia project podcasts.

This page was developed by Rutgers School of Social Work Instructional Designer Nick West.

The Rutgers 2017 MMP Page implements:

1. MaterializeCSS & JS
2. Scrollspy
3. vh CSS units(for landing page area)
4. Facebook Comments (currently deactivated, JS & bundle tag remain for quick implementation at program director's discretion)

## To Do:
1. Fix scrollspy landing areas (headers are too low)
2. Beautify code
3. Add background texture, maybe differentiate sections visually
